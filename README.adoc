This is a template AsciiDoc project, providing

- examples of the most widely used AsciiDoc features such as code blocks, references, images, videos, and math
- a scaleable document structure with sub-folders and files
- docker-compose and Makefiles that allow you to build your document by calling `make docs` from the root of this repository.
- Continuous integration for GitHub and GitLab, continuously building HTML and PDF output documents from the root AsciiDoc file link:/document/index.adoc[document/index.adoc].
